# Third Party Resources in Archives

- Ethical Issues of Collecting Social Media
- Look for Analogies with Current Collecting Practices (cite toolkit)
- One analogy is third party resources
- Archives are replete with things created by persons who did not donate the materials
- How might this parallel collecting social media data
- Start by analyzing possible exceptions to collecting social media

1. Creators of social media data do not intend for their data to be collected by archives
Neither do creators of other physical and digital media. It's usual for creators themselves not to expect to be donating their materials to archives. A common response to curatorial inquiries is "What value would my materials be?" Except in the possible rare occurrences when someone is dealing with, e.g., corresponding, with a widely known individual, it's highly unlikely they will anticipate their materials ending up anywhere other than the person with whom they're sharing materials. There is a clear distinction to be made between individuals who share media with an individual, perhaps privately, and those who share media in a public forum like Twitter or Instagram.  Further, with social media data, archives have the possibility of communicating with creators of social media data far better than they do with creators of traditional archival media.[1]

2. Archives are intentionally targeting and harvesting social media creators
So, too, are we highly intentional with our targeting of resource creators and harvesting, i.e., collecting or curating, of physical materials. In fact, the targeted curation of a collection is arguably the value provided by the archives and the curatorial staff.[2]

Intentionality and targeting can be leveraged to build or reinforce relationships with communities in the same way we do with donors of physical and digital collections. For instance, we [3] target social media accounts and hashtags that are related to existing collecting areas. By building on existing collecting patterns, extending our harvesting work to include social media data (not to mention other web-based content) it seems less creepy[4], and and more based on historical assessment.

3. Surveillance
Surveillance, using web-generated data, is no doubt a large social issue that needs critical examination, and libraries and archives are participating in that discussion.[5] But there is a distinction between harvesting data for purposes of personal tracking for marketing, legal harassment, national security, and criminal investigations (paranoid and otherwise), and for those which support build social, medical, and historical knowledge.[6] Governments and corporations have a more direct path to data for purposes of surveillance than archives.

But, does the field need to examine whether it's OK to be collecting materials from third party creators?

[2] All collecting, like knowledge, is situated, which might be defined as biased and subjective. This does not mean that a curator does not bring expertise to his or her job, nor does it preclude a diverse and representative collection from being built. Whether diverse and representative collections are being built is another question
